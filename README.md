# DRL for real-time scheduling in wireless networks

ND-initialization.py trains a model from the base ND algorithm.

ND-trained-model.py evaluates the performance of the trained model.

<!-- A2C-batch.py runs the basic off-policy Actor-Critic algorithm, with the pretrained model (Actor).

A2C-batch-multisamples.py runs the modified Actor-Critic algorithm, which generates multiple samples during each time slot, with the pretrained model (Actor). -->

A2C-on-policy-paralle.py runs the on-policy Actor-Critic algorithm, with the pretrained model (Actor).
